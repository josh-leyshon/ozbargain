      "description": "Found a great deal while trying to look for face masks for my kids. The vendor is on a Clearance sale and offers some of their medical products completely free.\nHowever, there is a shipping fee at the checkout and varies from product to product as to how much it will cost. Nonetheless, it is still a great deal especially if you wanted to buy bulk or wholesale quantity. They offer antigen test kits, face masks, and face shields for kids and for adults for FREE.\nAlthough there is no indicator as to when will the sale be closed, it is still a good opportunity to grab this limited-time offer until the supplies last.",

      "description": "One of my keepers - excellent dram at a reasonable price\nIf you're like many and enjoy a little something sweet after a good meal Ardbeg Distillery Uigeadail will have you leaving the table early instead of waiting for dessert. It has the deep smokey peatiness that you expect in an Islay single malt scotch but is more reminiscent of a Christmas pudding cooked over an open fire. Aging in old ex-Sherry casks gives it raisiny tones with edges of chocolate fudge topped with caramel, roasted walnuts and currants and it finishes with sweet tingly spices, olives and honey barbecue. A sweeter symphony was never written.\nA special vatting that marries Ardbeg’s traditional deep, smoky notes with luscious, raisiny tones of old ex-Sherry casks. It's non chill-filtered at high strength, which retains maximum flavour and gives more body and added depth. In 2009, Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible named Ardbeg Uigeadail ‘World Whisky of the Year’ – in praise of its “utter silky brilliance” and “complexity on a level only a handful of distilleries in the world can even dream of reaching.”\nRegion: Islay, Scotland\nOriginal Coupon Deal",
